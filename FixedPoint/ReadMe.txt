here fixed point adders/multipliers should be added
This folder includes 3 main vhdl codes which represent the implementations of:
1- A full adder
2- A half adder
3- An accurate 2bit*2bit multiplier
These 3 implementations are used to develop an accurate 4bit*4bit multiplier which is then used to construct an accurate 8bit*8bit multiplier.
The testbench for each implementation is also included.
